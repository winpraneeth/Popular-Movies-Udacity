#Popular Movies
As a part of the Android developer Nanodegree program in this project, I built an app to allow users to discover the most popular and top rated movies playing.
##Features
Upon launch, present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters and allows the user to:
*	Change the sort order to view either the most popular or the highest rated movies or favorite movies.
*	View the movie details such as Title, Overview, Reviews, Rating and play trailers.
*	Mark movies as favorite and save locally.
